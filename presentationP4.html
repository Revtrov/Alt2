                <h2>What did I see from the data analysis</h2>
                <p>From the Radius simulation i can cleary see that most planets we discover are almost twice earths size. This and the orbit period graph show that my Hypothesis is incorrect as most exoplanets we have found do not share similar features
                    to earth. The mass bar chart also disagreed with my Hypothesis showing that over half of the confirmed exoplanets were several earth masses or more.<br>

                <h2>What about my Hypothesis was correct?</h2>
                <p>
                    The heatmapping of the planets showed that of most of the planets discovered earth was closer to the hottest planet temperature than the cold. The average planets tempurature however was quite close to earths varying only a few degrees. This is the only
                    data set that matches earths features in my research.
