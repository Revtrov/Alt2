                    <br> From this visualisation we can see that the average radii and mean radii differ. Both however are much larger than that of Earths. The average radii is 7.9081153846153835 and the median radii is 16.7575 time that of the Earth's
                    radius. This information shows that according to the radii alone my Hypothesis is already looking incorrect </p>

                    <br> This graph shows the orbit ranges compared to the largest exoplanet orbit. The blue circle is the average orbit distance of exoplanets we have discovered. The red circle indicates the distance of earths orbit. This shows that
                    in terms of orbit my Hypothesis has also been disproven.

                <p>
                    Wikipedia was created to be the sum of all human knowledge. Its website is extremely vast and its data amounts to multiple petabytes. Wikipedia is a staple in many projects as it contains all the information you would find at other scources and more.
