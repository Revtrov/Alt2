                <p>
                    The hunt for Earth like exoplanets was started to see if any habitable planets existed other than our own. As we look to the skies we see just how alone we are and we wonder is there anyone else other than us. Our search for other intelligent beings is
                    always reaching new heights and due to this we now have the ability to detect exoplanets and their features.

                <p>
                    The kepler space telescope is the most famous of the telescopes with the ability to find exoplanets. Its main mission was to locate earth like exoplanets around other stars. It exceeded its expected lifespan and observed for 9 years instead of 3.5. <br>Kepler
                    discovered 5,011 exoplanet candidates and 2,662 confirmed exoplanets. The list i am taking data from was mostly generated by this telescope.
